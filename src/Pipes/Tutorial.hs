{-| @pipes@ is a lightweight and powerful library for processing effectful
    streams in constant memory.

    @pipes@ supports a wide variety of stream programming abstractions, such as:

    * effectful 'Producer's (like generators),

    * effectful 'Consumer's (like iteratees)

    * effectful 'Pipe's (like Unix pipes), and:

    * 'ListT' done right.

    If you want a Quick Start guide, read the documentation in "Pipes.Prelude"
    from top to bottom.

    This tutorial is more extensive and explains the @pipes@ API in greater
    detail and illustrates several idioms.  You can follow along by using the
    complete code examples in the Appendix section at the bottom of this
    tutorial.

{- $producers
    @pipes@ represents an effectful stream of input using the 'Producer' type.
    A 'Producer' is a monad transformer that extends the base monad with the
    ability to incrementally 'yield' output to an anonymous downstream handler.

    The following @stdin@ 'Producer' shows how to incrementally read in lines
    from standard input and 'yield' them downstream, terminating when reaching
    the end of the input:

@
\-\- echo.hs

import Control.Monad (unless)
import Pipes
import qualified System.IO as IO

\-\-       +--------+-- A 'Producer' of 'String's
\-\-       |        |
\-\-       |        |      +-- The base monad is 'IO'
\-\-       |        |      |
\-\-       |        |      |  +-- Returns '()' when finished
\-\-       |        |      |  |
\-\-       v        v      v  v
stdin :: Producer String IO ()
stdin = do
    eof <- 'lift' $ IO.hIsEOF IO.stdin  -- 'lift' actions from the base monad
    unless eof $ do
        str <- 'lift' getLine           -- Read a line of input
        'yield' str                     -- 'yield' the line of input
        stdin                         -- Loop
@

    'yield' emits a value, suspending the current 'Producer' until the value is
    consumed:

@
'yield' :: (Monad m) => a -> 'Producer' a m ()
@

    The simplest way to consume a 'Producer' is a 'for' loop, which has the
    following type:

@
\-\-                  +-- Producer      +-- The body of the      +-- Returns new
\-\-                  |   to loop       |   loop                 |   Producer
\-\-                  v   over          v                        v  
\-\-                  --------------    ---------------------    --------------
'for' :: (Monad m) => 'Producer' a m r -> (a -> 'Producer' b m r) -> 'Producer' b m r
@

    Notice how this greatly resembles the type of @(flip concatMap)@:

@
flip concatMap :: [a] -> (a -> [b]) -> [b]
@

    That's because 'for' behaves the same way.  'for' applies the body of the
    loop to each element of the 'Producer' and then flattens the results back
    into a new 'Producer'.

    Here's an example 'for' @loop@ in action:

@
\-\- echo.hs

\-\-               +-- 'loop' doesn't emit any new values, so 'a' is polymorphic
\-\-               |
\-\-               v
loop :: 'Producer' a IO ()
loop = 'for' stdin $ \str -> do  -- Read this like: \"for str in stdin\"
    'lift' $ putStrLn str        -- The body of the 'for' loop

\-\- even better: loop = 'for' stdin ('lift' . putStrLn)
@

    Notice how 'loop' does not re-emit any values in the body of the 'for' loop.
    @pipes@ defines a type synonym for this special case:

@
data 'X'  -- The uninhabited type

type 'Effect' m r = 'Producer' 'X' m r
@

    Since 'X' is uninhabited, a 'Producer' only type-checks as an 'Effect' if
    the 'Producer' never outputs any values.  @loop@ satisfies this criterion,
    so we can narrow the type signature of @loop@ even further to:

@
loop :: (Monad m) => 'Effect' IO ()
@

    'Effect's are special because we can 'run' any 'Effect' and convert it back
    to the base monad:

@
run :: (Monad m) => 'Effect' m r -> m r
@

    'run' only accepts 'Effect's in order to avoid silently discarding unhandled
    output.  Our @loop@ has no unhandled output, so we are good to go:

@
\-\- echo.hs

main :: IO ()
main = run loop

\-\- or you could just inline the 'loop':
\-\- main = run $ 'for' stdin ('lift' . putStrLn)
@

    Our final program loops over standard input and echoes every line to
    standard output until we hit @Ctrl-D@ to end the input stream:

@
$ ghc -O2 echo.hs
$ ./echo
Test\<Enter\>
Test
ABC\<Enter\>
ABC
\<Ctrl-D\>
$
@

    You can also loop over lists, too.  To do so, convert the list to a
    'Producer' using 'each':

@
'each' :: (Monad m) => [a] -> 'Producer' a m ()
'each' as = mapM_ 'yield' as
@

    Use this to iterate over lists using a \"foreach\" loop:

>>> run $ for (each [1..4]) (lift . print)
1
2
3
4

-}

{- $theory
    You might wonder why the body of a 'for' loop can be a 'Producer'.  Let's
    test out this feature by defining a new loop body that @duplicate@s every
    value:

@
\-\- nested.hs

import Pipes
import qualified Pipes.Prelude as P  -- Pipes.Prelude already has stdin

duplicate :: (Monad m) => a -> 'Producer' a m ()
duplicate x = do
    'yield' x
    'yield' x

loop :: 'Producer' String IO ()
loop = 'for' P.stdin duplicate

\-\- This is the exact same as:
\-\-
\-\- loop = 'for' P.stdin $ \x -> do
\-\-     'yield' x
\-\-     'yield' x
@

    This time our @loop@ outputs 'String's, specifically two copies of every
    line that we read from standard input.

    Since @loop@ is itself a 'Producer', we can loop over our @loop@:

@
\-\- nested.hs

\-\- I heard you like loops
main = run $ 'for' loop ('lift' . putStrLn)
@

    This creates a program which echoes every line from standard input to
    standard output twice:

@
$ ./nested
Test\<Enter\>
Test
Test
ABC\<Enter\>
ABC
ABC
\<Ctrl-D\>
$
@

    But is this feature really necessary?  Couldn't we have instead written this
    using a nested for loop?

@
main = run $
    for P.stdin $ \str1 ->
        'for' (duplicate str1) $ \str2 ->
            'lift' $ putStrLn str
@

    Yes, we could have!  In fact, this is a special case of the following
    equality, which always holds no matter what:

@
\-\- m :: (Monad m) =>      'Producer' a m ()  -- i.e. P.stdin
\-\- f :: (Monad m) => a -> 'Producer' b m ()  -- i.e. 'duplicate'
\-\- g :: (Monad m) => b -> 'Producer' c m ()  -- i.e. '('lift' . putStrLn)'

'for' ('for' m f) g = 'for' m (\x -> 'for' (f x) g)
@

    We can understand the rationale behind this equality if we define the
    following operator that is the point-free counterpart to 'for':

@
('~>') :: (Monad m)
     => (a -> 'Producer' b m r)
     -> (b -> 'Producer' c m r)
     -> (a -> 'Producer' c m r)
(f '~>' g) x = 'for' (f x) g
@

    Using this operator we can transform our original equality into the
    following more symmetric form:

@
f :: (Monad m) => a -> 'Producer' b m r
g :: (Monad m) => b -> 'Producer' c m r
h :: (Monad m) => c -> 'Producer' d m r

\-\- Associativity
(f '~>' g) '~>' h = f '~>' (g '~>' h)
@

    This looks just like an associativity law.  In fact, ('~>') has another nice
    property, which is that 'yield' is its left and right identity:

@
\-\- Left Identity
'yield' '~>' f = f

\-\- Right Identity
f '~>' 'yield' = f
@

    In other words, 'yield' and ('~>') form a 'Control.Category.Category' where
    ('~>') plays the role of the composition operator and 'yield' is the
    identity.

    Notice that if we translate the left identity law to use 'for' instead of
    ('~>') we get:

@
'for' ('yield' x) f = f x
@

    This just says that if you iterate over a single-element 'Producer' with no
    side effects, then you can instead cut out the middle man and directly apply
    the body of the loop to that single element.

    If we translate the right identity law to use 'for' instead of ('~>') we
    get:

@
'for' m 'yield' = m
@

    This just says that if the only thing you do is re-'yield' every element of
    a stream, you get back your original stream.

    These three \"for loop\" laws summarize our intuition for how 'for' loops
    should behave:

@
'for' ('for' m f) g = 'for' m (\x -> 'for' (f x) g)

'for' ('yield' x) f = f x

'for' m 'yield' = m
@

    In fact, we get more out of this than just a bunch of equations.  We also
    get a useful operator, too: ('~>').  We can use this operator to condense
    our original code into the following more succinct form:

@
main = run $ 'for' P.stdin (duplicate '~>' 'lift' . putStrLn)
@

    This means that we can also choose to program in a more functional style and
    think of stream processing in terms of composing transformations using
    ('~>') instead of nesting a bunch of 'for' loops.

    The above example is a microcosm of the design philosophy behind the @pipes@
    library:

    * Define primitives in terms of categories

    * Specify expected behavior in terms of category laws

    * Think compositionally instead of sequentially
-}

{- $consumers
    Sometimes you don't want use a 'for' loop because you don't want to consume
    every element of a 'Producer' or because you don't want to process every
    value of a 'Producer' the exact same way.

    The most general solution is to externally iterate over the 'Producer' using
    the 'next' command:

@
next :: (Monad m) => 'Producer' a m r -> m ('Either' r (a, 'Producer' a m r))
@

    Think of 'next' as pattern matching on the head of the 'Producer'.  This
    'Either' returns a 'Left' if the 'Producer' is done or it returns a 'Right'
    containing the next value, @a@, along with the remainder of the 'Producer'.

    However, sometimes we can get away with something a little more elegant,
    like a 'Consumer', which represents an effectful sink of values.  A
    'Consumer' is a monad transformer that extends the base monad with the
    ability to incrementally 'await' input from an anonymous upstream source.
    The following @printN@ 'Consumer' shows how to 'print' out only the first
    @n@ elements received:

@
\-\- printn.hs

import Control.Monad (replicateM_)
import Pipes
import qualified Pipes.Prelude as P

\-\-               +--------+-- A 'Consumer' of 'String's
\-\-               |        |
\-\-               v        v
printN :: Int -> 'Consumer' String IO ()
printN n = replicateM_ n $ do  -- Repeat the following block 'n' times
    str <- 'await'               -- 'await' a new 'String'
    'lift' $ putStrLn str        -- Print out the 'String'
@

    'await' is the dual of 'yield': we suspend our 'Consumer' until we receive a
    new value:

@
'await' :: (Monad m) => 'Consumer' a m a
@

    One way to feed a 'Consumer' is to repeatedly feed the same input using
    using ('>~'):

@
\-\-                   +- Feed       +- Consumer to    +- Returns new
\-\-                   |  action     |  feed           |  Effect
\-\-                   v             v                 v  
\-\-                   ----------    --------------    ----------
('>~') :: (Monad m) => 'Effect' m b -> 'Consumer' b m c -> 'Effect' m c
@

    This runs the given 'Effect' every time the 'Consumer' 'await's a value,
    using the return value of the 'Effect' to supply the input:

>>> run $ lift getLine >~ printN 3
Test<Enter>
Test
ABC<Enter>
ABC
42<Enter>
42
>>>

    You might wonder why ('>~') uses an 'Effect' instead of a raw action in the
    base monad.  The reason why is that ('>~') actually permits the following
    more general type:

@
(>~) :: (Monad m) => 'Consumer' a m b -> 'Consumer' b m c -> 'Consumer' a m c
@

    We can feed a 'Consumer' with yet another 'Consumer' so that you can 'await'
    while you 'await'.  For example, we could define the following intermediate
    'Consumer' that requests two 'String's and returns them concatenated:

@
\-\- printn.hs

doubleUp :: (Monad m) => 'Consumer' String m String
doubleUp = do
    str1 <- 'await'
    str2 <- 'await'
    return (str1 ++ str2)

\-\- even better: doubleUp = (++) <$> 'await' 'Control.Applicative.<*>' 'await'
@

    We can now insert this in between @(lift getLine)@ and @printN@ and see what
    happens:

>>> run $ lift getLine >~ doubleUp >~ printN 3
Test<Enter>
ing<Enter>
Testing
ABC<Enter>
DEF<Enter>
ABCDEF
42<Enter>
000<Enter>
42000

    'doubleUp' splits every request from 'printN' into two separate requests and
    returns back the concatenated result.
-}

{- $pipes
    Use ('>->') to connect a 'Producer' to a 'Consumer':

@
('>->') :: (Monad m)
     => 'Producer' a m r
     -> 'Consumer' a m r
     -> 'Effect'     m r
@

    This returns an 'Effect' which we can 'run':

@
\-\- printn.hs

main = run $ P.stdin '>->' printN 3
@

    This will prompt the user for input three times, echoing each input:

@
$ ./printn
Test\<Enter\>
Test
ABC\<Enter\>
ABC
42\<Enter\>
42
$
@

    ('>->') pairs every 'await' in the 'Consumer' with a 'yield' in the
    'Producer'.  Since our 'Consumer' only calls 'await' three times, our
    'Producer' only 'yield's three times and therefore only prompts the user
    for input three times.  Once the 'Consumer' terminates the whole 'Effect'
    terminates.

    The opposite is true, too: if the 'Producer' terminates, then the whole
    'Effect' terminates.

@
$ ./printn
Test\<Enter\>
Test
\<Ctrl-D\>
$
@

    This is why ('>->') requires that both the 'Producer' and 'Consumer' share
    the same type of return value: whichever one terminates first provides the
    return value for the entire 'Effect'.

    Let's test this by modifying our 'Producer' to return 'False' and our
    'Consumer' to return 'True':

@
\-\- printn.hs

import Control.Applicative ((<$))  -- (<$) modifies return values

main = do
    finished <- run $ (False <$ P.stdin) >-> (True <$ printN 3)
    putStrLn $ if finished then \"Success!\" else \"You had one job...\"
@

    This lets us diagnose whether the 'Producer' or 'Consumer' terminated first:

@
$ ./printn
Test\<Enter\>
Test
ABC\<Enter\>
ABC
42\<Enter\>
42
Success!
$ ./printn
\<Ctrl-D\>
You had one job...
$
@

    You might wonder why ('>->') returns an 'Effect' that we have to 'run'
    instead of directly returning an action in the base monad.  This is because
    you can connect things other than 'Producer's and 'Consumer's, like 'Pipe's.
    A 'Pipe' is a monad transformer that is a mix between a 'Producer' and
    'Consumer', because a 'Pipe' can both 'await' and 'yield'.  The following
    @take@ 'Pipe' only allows a fixed number of values to pass through:

{- $conclusion
    This tutorial covers the core concepts of connecting, building, and reading
    @pipes@ code.  However, this library is only the core component in an
    ecosystem of streaming components.  More powerful libraries that build upon
    @pipes@ include:

    * @pipes-safe@: Resource management and exception safety for @pipes@

    * @pipes-concurrency@: Concurrent reactive programming and message passing

    * @pipes-parse@: Central idioms for stream parsing

    * @pipes-arrow@: Push-based directed acyclic graphs for @pipes@

    These libraries provide functionality specialized to common streaming
    domains.  Additionally, there are several derived libraries on Hackage that
    provide even higher-level functionality, which you can find by searching
    under the \"Pipes\" category or by looking for packages with a @pipes-@
    prefix in their name.  Current examples include:

    * @pipes-network@/@pipes-network-tls@: Networking

    * @pipes-zlib@: Compression and decompression

    * @pipes-binary@: Binary serialization

    * @pipes-attoparsec@: High-performance parsing

    Even these derived packages still do not explore the full potential of
    @pipes@ functionality.  Advanced @pipes@ users can explore this library in
    greater detail by studying the documentation in the "Pipes" module to learn
    about the symmetry behind the underlying 'Proxy' type and operators.
